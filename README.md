# cljkafka

A simple Clojure library designed to help using Kafka.

The library is very simple yet customizable enough.

    (with-producer p {}
                   (send! p "test" "message from clojure"))

    (with-consumer c {} ["test"]                       ;; List of subscribed topics -- ["test"]
                   (while true
                          (println (poll c "test" 100)))) ;; 100ms -- timeout

     (with-consumer c {} ["test"]
                    (poll-loop c "test" println))           ;; Check infinitely
